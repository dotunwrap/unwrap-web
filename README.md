# <p align="center">Gabby's Portfolio Site :3</p>

This is the monorepo for [my personal portfolio website](https://www.dotunwrap.dev).

## [Frontend](/frontend)

The frontend is written using the following:
- Svelte 5
- SvelteKit 2
- TailwindCSS 4
- TypeScript

The site is currently deployed on GitHub Pages using a [CD action](/.github/workflows/frontend-cd.yml).

## [Backend](/backend)

The backend is written in Go using Gin. It's currently undeployed and unused, but sitting here waiting for a moment where I might need some endpoints or DB interaction.
